# Protein Prediction workshop

## Details
Location to be confirmed VUB U-residence
Date: after the summer 2019

Instructor: Niloofar Shirvanizadeh

## Overview

There are now well over 130 million protein sequences available from Uniprot, and for only a small fraction of these
(about 2%) structural information is available from the Protein Data Bank. Uniprot provides a mix of manual and automatic
functional and structural annotations for these sequences, but when working on a particular research question you might 
want to obtain more detailed insights into the possible behavior of the protein(s) you are interested in.

In this workshop, we address how to predict features of proteins from their sequence only, using Python scripts to access 
APIs of web services available online. We will introduce single-sequence based predictions of biophysical characteristics 
of proteins (e.g. DynaMine for backbone dynamics), methods that use multiple sequence alignments (e.g. I-TASSER), and methods
that determine the difference between a protein and its mutant form (e.g. DEOGEN2). We will also show how the results of these
predictions can be combined and analysed using a protein case study.
